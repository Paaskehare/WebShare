WebShare
========

Simple folder sharing using python

When ran from the commandline, this handy tool will serve the current directory statically using the build in webserver from python.
But with the addition of a neat layout

**Supports Python 2 and 3**

The stylesheet is hardcoded in the file, but can easily be altered for personal preference.
If `~/.config/webshare.css` is found it will use that instead of the hardcoded stylesheet.

`webshare.css` is provided as a template, it contains the same styling that the application will use by default.
